                                                   Analytics Using SQL
In real-world applications, we see a large amount of data being generated on a daily basis.
How do you think we can handle this data? How can you store huge, structured data securely
for future use? How can you manage and access the data stored in a structured database? 
Learning to represent data in the form of tables in a Relational Database will help you answer these questions.
we will learn to create, update, and retrieve data stored in the MySQL (RDBMS) database. 
You will use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to perform various operations on the database.
